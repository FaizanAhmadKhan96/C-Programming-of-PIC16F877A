# C-programming-for-PIC16F877A

This repository contains different codes developed for programming PIC16F877A used in my Bachelors final year project which was a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) based solar charge controller module and then installing it in an existing locally manufactured uninterrupted power supply (UPS) unit.

Each of these codes were first tested in real time simulations using Proteus software before burning it into our PIC microcontroller. An example of one such simulation is shown below in a screen recording:
